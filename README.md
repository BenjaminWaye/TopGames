# TopGames
Sample that downloads and visualizes data from twitch 

Feedback on task
1. Interesting.
2. The specified API by default returns top 10 games, unlike specified 25

Assumptions:
1. Do MVC.
2. Prepare quick sample to show list from some APIâ€¨

Alternative approach:
Scalable apps, that need to keep modularity and testability would benefit using MVVM design pattern which is not implemented in the sample since it requires more time to prepare additional layers of classes. Data providers would then be presented through interfaces, keeping single responsibility per unit approach.
